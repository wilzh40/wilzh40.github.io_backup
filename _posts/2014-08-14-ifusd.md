### I started making an app and learning swift

For the school district. I feel like after ~3 projects, I definitely am getting the hang of it. In 30 seconds, I setup a repository locally, pushed it to a new github repo, added a .gitignore, a formatting guide to the newbies I'll have to teach, as well as added swift resources.

I also implemented a side menu skeleton for the actual app, iOS 8 ready.
