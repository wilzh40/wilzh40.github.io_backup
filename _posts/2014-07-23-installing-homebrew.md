### I needed python

To download and compile Sibernetics, I had to have Python.
To have Python, the easiest way was to install Homebrew.
And so I installed it using [http://brew.sh/](Homebrew).

To be honest, it was extremely streamlined, and even GUI-friendly for a console script. It even had a progress bar.
