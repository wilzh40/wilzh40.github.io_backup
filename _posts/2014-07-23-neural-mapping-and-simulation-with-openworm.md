### The brain is truly the last frontier

> "What I cannot create, I cannot understand"

And I want to be part of it. How, you may ask? I've decided to apply and familiarize myself with an intriguing open-source project aptly named [OpenWorm](http://www.openworm.org/). It is fruitless to attempt to model the billions of neurons within our brian--the connectome--without validating the model in the first place. And that is what OpenWorm attempts to solve. Openworm's goal: to create the first fully programmtic multicellular organism--flesh,neurons,blood,all--inside the mere confines of a computer. This is the landmark first step crack the code (forget the human genome, that was child's play) of the human connectome.

### Why a worm?

[C. Elegans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans) is the simplest multicellular organism to exist on this planet. It has a total of a couple of thousand cells, but more importantly only 302 neurons. Did you get read that right?
**302 Neurons**. 

That monumentally small amount of neurons means something spectacular for the coding community: that each and every neuron can be programtically represented as a node. And that makes it possible for regular joes like you and me to contribute to this project, to make a project large in ambition but relatively manageable in scope. 

Amen.
