### Publishing a static site is easy

Hosting is expensive, so it's pretty amazing that github will host your static websites for the low price of zero dollars. It's pretty simple:

1. Make an account on github
2. Make a repository titled (insertusernamehere).github.io
3. Push whatever files (html, css, jquery) into your repo
4. Wait around 10 minutes
5. It's automatically generated on (insertusernamehere).github.io !
