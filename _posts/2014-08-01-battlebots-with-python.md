### I wanted to learn Python quick

And I found this amazing website called [robotgame.net](https://robotgame.net/). What is it? In essence, you write a short python class for a robot to battle other AI robots in a 19x19 arena.

There are 100 turns and the player with the most robots at the end of round wins. Each robot can do one of four functions each turn:
 - Attack an adjacent square (8 Damage to opponent robots)
 - Move to an adjacnet square (5 Damage if object already there)
 - Guard (Recieve half damage)
 - and Suicide (Deal 15 Damage)
 
I get to learn how to use Python and build robots that fight to death? Consider me convinced.
