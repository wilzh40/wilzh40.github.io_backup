### Y Combinator hosted this event in Cupertino

Let me break it down. Y Combinator Startup School was an event that invited top startup CEOs to talk about their experiences as well as lessons learned within the startup industry. I applied and one of the 1700 different people that were accepted (it was free!). But I was probably the youngest: when I got there, there were no high schoolers, but battle-hardened college students and aspiring entrepreneuers, both working for startups or thinking of making their own. I came almost on a whim to find out if this startup business was right for me.
And boy, was I amazed. 

Here was the roster:

So many things happened. Listened to how the founder of Twitch.tv had to pivot from a reality show revolved around a guy named Justin into one of the biggest gaming networks in the world. Listenedto how Jan Koum, founder of WhatsApp, dropped out of college to work for Yahoo, only to drop out of Yahoo 9 years later to find their own startup. Listened to how Hosain Rahman struggled with almost **everything**, from breaking into the hardware market when the only successful startup (at the time) was Apple, having their orders cancelled during the 2008 recession, and managing a product recall when Jawbone Up was defective. 

But the most important part, out of all, was the first speech made by Ron Conway, one of the biggest angel investors in the area. I certain part stuck with me. 

### Ron Conway doesn't invest in ideas. He invests in **people**.

This made me depressed and inspired at the same time. Why? I'm probably not the born entrepreneur. I lack the resistance to sleep deprivation that many CEOs have. I certainly don't want to do two times the work for a questionable and unsustainable income, with major doubts about the future. But do I?
I'll have to make that decision myself.


### But I met some amazing people. 

I talked to the brightest minds in the Valley. People flew in from LA, took the bus from SF, trekked all the way from Chile and Canada, just for this event.
And these 1700 people I will no doubt meet again in my lifetime: they are my competitors, my mentors, my friends.
After the event I went with some new-found friends (most of them also the few like-minded high schoolers) to University Ave, near Stanford, and we had some dope Indian food, talked about nerdy stuff, and went home.

Also, I now know Dave Fontenot.
