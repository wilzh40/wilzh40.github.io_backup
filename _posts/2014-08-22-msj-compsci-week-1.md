Problem set :
[http://msjcs.github.io/weeklyproblems.html](http://msjcs.github.io/weeklyproblems.html)

Luckily, I know python this time, so I don't have to write 10000 lines of code in objc.

**0:**

	2193478542389654387527 % 3 = 1.
Easy.

**1: **

Luckily python has a built in modulo function
	pow(34875,12345678901234567890,30001) = 29850
    
**2:**

32 colors, no two vertices can be the same color...

I'm going to assume it is (32-n) x number of nodes, where n is the amount of edges connected to it. 
I need some paper to this
