###I've always wanted a good standing desk

But all the desks on the market are always so darn expensive. The cheapest ones such as UpDesk are about 500 bucks a pop. To make sure that I would love to use standing desks and somehow increase my productivity and the quality of posture through this exercise, I am going to build my own prototype. 

I went to IKEA for the first time in about 12 years. Considering I've only been on this Earth for about 17 years, it's safe to say that it was  an entirely new experience. I fell in love.

I bought everything according to the guide [for a 22 dollar IKEA hack](http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html). However, one problem; they ran out of LACK 11-inch shelving brackets! I had to make do with slightly more expensive (and sexier) red EKBY MANS brackets, but they were only 7 inch by 11 inch, not 11x11. All in all, I spent about 25 dollars in total, along with a dollar ice-cream cone.

A great day.
