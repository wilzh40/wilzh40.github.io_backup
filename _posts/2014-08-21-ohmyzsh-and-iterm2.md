### I wanted to revamp my terminal

I heard about Oh-my-zsh and iTerm2 at the shirts.io hackathon, when I saw someone coding away effeciently _inside the terminal_ using Vim. It was a terminal, but not the same terminal. They told me it was zsh, a revamp and upgrade of the outdated bash. So naturally, I had to try it out.

[iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/downloads.html)
[Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

It added so much functionality: autocomplete, search functions, non-mouse copy paste...who needs finder when you have terminal. I don't think I'm going back.
