### We're running out of Last Frontiers

When I was young, I always aspired to be an astronaut. The prospect of mindlessly drifting around in space was alluring. However, as time progressed, the enigmas of space slowly lost their charm; we blasted sattelites into space, sent rovers to faraway planets, and even planted a flag admist the wasteland we call the moon. But the wonder was still there, that collective feeling of humanity collaborating to transcend the very boundaries that define us was a lasting testament to the human spirit and innovation. Over time, however, I realized the last frontier wasn't neccesarily the endless void above our heads but rather the small lumps of grey matter inside them. The brain. 

There are 86 billion neurons within the human brain, each physiologically unique and contextually important. The human connectome—the neural map of the all the connections between all these individual neurons--is what allows the brain to function as it is. This map is what stores our memories, records our emotions, and controls our reflexes. This map is what defines our personality, our state of "being”, and ultimately humanity itself.

A couple of years ago we accomplished a major landmark, in the same spirit that landed a man on the moon 50 years ago. We completely mapped out the human genome, the full genetic code. But that, impressive as it is, is merely is a drop in a bucket compared to the magnitude, the complexitiy, the sheer wonder that is the connectome. But fear not .

Lyall Watson once said "If the brain were so simple we could understand it, we would be so simple we couldn’t." Let's prove him wrong.
