###Out of all the projects I have done so far, this was one was probably the most infuriating.

The post title reflects how I felt through this whole process that took a day and a half to setup an otherwise relatively simple website.

A bit of an overview: I was searching for a simple way to create a blog on my personal website and have it dynamically update. I wanted something that was:
- Free from all serverside hustle and bustle
- Easy to markup and markdown 
- Powerful yet basic
- Simple, bare-bones, and easy to install

What I found out that Jekyll, the hosting engine that supports this website, almost fit this description--in fact it fit all of them except for the last. And that's the main inspiration of writing this extremely meta blog post. 

###The potion

How did I found about Jekyll and its amazing capability to host blogs? I was subscriped to a facebook group called Hackathon Hackers (kind of redundant) when a small studio posted their webpage. Included was an extremely minimalistic blog that wasn't run by Wordpress, Twitter, or any other serverside blog hosting service. I immediately e-mailed the creators at [Leef](http://www.leef.io) and asked what they were using. They responded with this monstrosity: Jekyll.

I was curious about what it was and how it worked: apparently it had the capacity to automatically push commits and display them for github pages. It had no serverside code and automatically generates a **whole static site** from dynamic content. I did a little more googling and stumbled upon its bootstrapping site.
 
This is what I found out:
> Jekyll is a parsing engine bundled as a ruby gem used to build static websites from dynamic components such as templates, partials, liquid code, markdown, etc. Jekyll is known as "a simple, blog aware, static site generator".
>Jekyll is Not Blogging Software.
Jekyll is a parsing engine.
>Jekyll does not come with any content nor does it have any templates or design elements. This is a common source of confusion when getting started. Jekyll does not come with anything you actually use or see on your website - you have to make it.

And I kind of ignored it. It was extremely powerful: I had the ability to generate an entire site--HTML,CSS,jQuery,Blog Content,all-- with this plugin and I wanted to use it. I obediently followed the instructions at [the official website](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and installed the ruby gems. Little did I know how much I would learn about github, unix, ssh, and a bunch of other unrelated stuff in general. I just wanted and little place where I could scribble down my thoughts and struggles and document my journey of learning how to code.
