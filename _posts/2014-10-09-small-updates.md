### Quick updates

**Posting Frequency**

- Posting frequency has been dramatically reduced. I'm a busy high school senior who has Multivaribale calculus and college essays to worry about, and that always takes priority over coding-related projects. 


**OpenWorm**

- Openworm progress has been slightly delayed since I'm waiting for a better model and documentation to modify SPH hydrodynamics, and because it's not a summer where I can spend 30 hours figuring out a kernel bug on the Lenovo Y570 GPU


**Life**

- I've been going to the local coffeeshop every single day now, 7-9, it's great to meet new people after being cooped up all day. 

- I just bought [Antumbra Glow](https://antumbra.io/), a 35-dollar ambient light that plugs into the USB of the computer and displays the avg of the rendered GL pixels on a screen. It's open-source and hackable, and probably my next hacking project! However it comes in like 5 months because I missed the pre-sale beta.
I have an idea where I could link maybe the gracenote API to have the light = mood and have it pulse = BPM, that's pretty damn cool. It'll be an amazing addition to my standing desk.

- I feel like I've matured more in the past few months than in the last few years combined. Some amazing experiences, some less-so-amazing ones, but everything I learned. Including going to prestigious hackathons alone, contributing to open-source projects, and just straight-up _learning_.


**Return to normality**
- Probably when all college apps are done, somewhere in January!
